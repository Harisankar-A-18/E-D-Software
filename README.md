Hybrid Encryption and Decryption Software
Overview
This Python script implements a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application for hybrid encryption and decryption using XOR Cipher and Lucas Series algorithms. The application is built with PyQt5 library, providing an intuitive interface for users to encrypt and decrypt text data.
Features
•	Hybrid Encryption: Combines XOR Cipher and Lucas Series algorithms for enhanced security.
•	User-friendly Interface: Allows users to input keys and text data easily through the GUI.
•	Encryption: Encrypts user-provided text data using specified keys and algorithms.
•	Decryption: Decrypts encrypted text data using the same keys and algorithms.
Requirements
•	Python 3.x
•	PyQt5 library
Usage
1.	Install Python 3.x if not already installed on your system.
2.	Install PyQt5 library by running pip install PyQt5 in your terminal or command prompt.
3.	Run the script hybrid_encryption.py using Python.
4.	The GUI application window will appear, providing input fields for keys and text data.
5.	Enter the keys and text data you want to encrypt or decrypt.
6.	Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the text data.
7.	Click the "Decrypt" button to decrypt the encrypted text data.
8.	Encrypted or decrypted text will be displayed in message boxes.
Code Structure
•	hybrid_encryption.py: Main Python script implementing the GUI application and encryption/decryption functionality.
•	README.md: This documentation file providing an overview of the software and usage instructions.
